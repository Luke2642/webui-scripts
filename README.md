# Scripts for Automatic1111

Scripts go in the automatic1111 stable-diffusion-webui / scripts folder.

## Prompt S/R Batch

Generating e.g. 4 images in 1 batch is slightly faster than 4x1 image, this script allows you to change the prompt across 1 batch.

It works like the prompt s/r in xyz grid, search and replace, but, also overrides the batch setting.

So, put 'car' in the main automatic1111 prompt. Select 'Prompt S/R Batch' from the scripts drop down. 

In the textbox, put 'car, house, tree, frog' in the text box, and boom, 4 images in 1 batch, each with its own prompt.
